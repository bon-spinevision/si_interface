# Usage protocol for the SI interface
## Prerequisites
If you only want to use the software, install the latest version from the [repository page](https://github.com/bon-spinevision/si_interface).

Otherwise if you wish to modify the project, follow these steps before launching the code :

1) Install Python : the project uses Python 3.13.2 . You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3132/). Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH environment (the installation wizard should do it for you).

2) clone the repository :
```
git clone git@github.com:bon-spinevision/si_interface.git
```

4) Install the libraries :
```
py -m pip -r install requirements.txt
```

4) run the program :
```
py main.py
```

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to view and (in the near future) calibrate the force values exerted on a Smart Instrument.
